Important files:

	header.mak	for use with 'gmakemake > Makefile'

	*.asm		sample source programs
	*.obj		sample object programs
	*.out		sample output files

	RUN		script to run z88 against the object files

You can create your own object files by using the simple assembler (found
in the project's pub directory, /usr/local/pub/wrc/courses/arch/z88).
See the README.z88asm file there for details.

Test files have the following naming convention:

	handout.asm	sample program from the project specification
	err-*.asm	tests for error detection
	f-*.asm		tests that require forwarding
	s-*.asm		tests that require stalling
	fs-*.asm	tests that require forwarding and stalling
	*.asm		tests that don't require forwarding or stalling

Object files are created this way:

	z88asm file.asm > file.obj

The assembly language syntax is described in the README.z88asm file.

The RUN script can be used to test your simulator against any or all of
the supplied test programs.  It will run your simulator against one or
more object files and compare the results against my sample output; if
there are any differences, a difference listing will be generated.

You can give object file names on the command line to test against only
those specifie files; if none are listed, all object files are tested.

Run the script from inside the directory that contains your simulator.
Here are some example commands:

	RUN				run against all .obj files
	RUN add.obj			run only add 
	RUN add.obj sub.obj		run only these two tests
